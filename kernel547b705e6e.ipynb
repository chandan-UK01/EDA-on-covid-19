If you look at the data number of cases in India is rising but not like in Italy, Wuhan, S.Korea, Spain, or USA. Don't get fool by these numbers (COVID cases in India). I think the number is less because of low awareness and less tests being conducted in India. Currently India is a deadly and risky zone as there are very few COVID-19 test centres in India.  Imagine how many infected people are still around you and are infecting others unknowingly.
